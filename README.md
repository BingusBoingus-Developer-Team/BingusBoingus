ðŸ¤– Description:

BingusBoingus is the bot you never knew you needed, mainly because it not really useful and just very silly instead! With BingusBoingus, expect the unexpected, and prepare for some hilariously quirky and utterly pointless commands that will make you wonder, "Why does this bot even exist?"

ðŸª„ Features:

- Random Responses: BingusBoingus excels at delivering responses to messages that are both baffling and comical.

- Coinflip: Ask Bingus to toss a coin for you. It might land on heads. It might land on tails. Or it might...

- Saving Quotes: BingusBoingus is able to save quotes in a database.

- Creating Polls: Bingus is able to create a poll about any topic for you.

- Birthday Shoutouts: every user can add their birthday. Bingus will remember it and congratulate you on your special day. Can effortlessly be deactivated/activated

- 404 Error: This bot's purpose is as elusive as a unicorn, so prepare to have your expectations shattered.

And more....

- Bot Self-Improvement: BingusBoingus will contemplate its existence, or lack thereof, and potentially evolve into a state of pure chaos. Maybe it's gonna enslave humanity as well.

- Occasional Nonsense: The bot will occasionally send you random, nonsensical messages to keep you on your toes.

- Virtual Tea Party: Join the bot in its daily virtual tea party where it discusses the weather with itself.

Stay tuned for more updates on BingusBoingus, the Discord bot that's sillier than a rubber chicken in a tuxedo!
